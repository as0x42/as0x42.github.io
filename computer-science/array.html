  <h1>Arrays in Computer Science</h1>
  <p>An <strong>array</strong> is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored sequentially in memory. Each
    element can be accessed directly using an index, which represents its position within the array. Arrays are a
    fundamental data structure in computer science, with native support in programming languages like C, C++, Java,
    JavaScript, Python, and more.</p>
  <p>Common algorithms done on arrays are searching and sorting. Some of the most efficient array search algorithms,
    like binary search, assume the array is sorted beforehand.</p>
  <p>A <em>subarray</em> is a contiguous subset of an array. For example, given the array
    <code>[2, 6, 1, 10, 7, 14, 3]</code>, a subarray would be <code>[1, 10, 7]</code>.</p>
  <p>A <em>subsequence</em> of an array means deleting some or no elements without changing the overall order. A
    subsequence of the above array might be <code>[6, 10, 7]</code>, but not <code>[10, 6, 2]</code>.</p>
  <h2>Navigation Using Initial Address</h2>
  <p>Given an array of five 2-byte elements located at memory location 1000, the memory location of the <em>i</em>-th
    element can be found using the equation <code>1000 + (i x 2)</code>. In other words, the memory location of the
    fourth element (index 3) will be <code>1000 + (3 x 2)</code> = <code>1006</code>. Note that because this equation
    doesn't depend on the size of the array - only its initial memory address and element size - accessing arbitrary
    elements in an array is an <code>O(1)</code> operation.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of Arrays</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple and intuitive design. A list of elements in contiguous memory locations is one of the easiest to
        understand.</li>
      <li>Low overhead. No need to maintain pointers for every element in the array. We simply have to know the initial
        memory location, element size, and overall array size, and we can access all subsequent elements.</li>
      <li>Efficient navigation due to constant-time random access.</li>
      <li>Because they are contained in a contiguous sequence of memory, arrays are very <em>cache-friendly</em>. If a
        program accesses one element of an array, it's likely it will access its neighbors relatively soon. Since the
        elements are physically stored one after the other, a CPU can cache an entire chunk of memory, storing not just
        one element, but all nearby elements as well, avoiding unnecessary memory queries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages of Arrays</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Depending on the implementation, arrays can be fixed in size. If you fill an array and want to store another
        element, you have to re-allocate an entirely new array and copy over the elements from the old one to the new,
        taking <code>O(n)</code> time. However, with a proper resizing factor, we can reduce this penalty as the array
        gets larger and larger.</li>
      <li>Inefficient insertion and deletion. While traversal is cheap, inserting or deleting an element into an array
        requires shifting all subsequent elements. The best-case scenario is inserting/deleting the last element,
        avoiding this penalty. The worst-case is inserting or deleting at the beginning, requiring the entire rest of
        the array to be readjusted.</li>
      <li>Space inefficient. If we have an array of size 10 but only use 2 spaces, the remaining 8 spaces are being
        wasted until we fill them.</li>
    </ul>
