  <h1>Notebooks</h1>
  <p>Notebooks collecting references, observations, mini-essays, and quotations. Some of them turn into something more. Others just sit and
    rot, waiting for a flash of insight to make them useful. If something I've written here is wrong, or could be expanded on more, please

    <p><b>Hey, this looks like <a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks/">that other guy</a>.</b></p>
    <p>Imitation is the highest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness.</p>
    <p><b>Why is the website so ugly?</b></p>
    <p><a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Because it doesn't need to be anything more</a>. The goal here is to store information
    for later usage and build up insights, not maximize downloaded JavaScript.</p>
