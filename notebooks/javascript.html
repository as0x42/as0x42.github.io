      <p>One of the "Big Three" web technologies, along with HTML and CSS. Created at Netscape by Brendan Eich for their browser Navigator
        in 1995. A true programming language providing dynamic functionality to otherwise static and dormant web pages. DOM manipulation is
        not baked into the JS language. Instead, it's provided through an API, keeping the DOM language-independent and allowing JS the
        flexibility to expand outside the web with runtimes like Node.js.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is...</p>
      <p><span class="bolded">Just-in-time (JIT) compiled</span>: JavaScript engines like V8 (the Chrome engine) allow source code compilation at
      runtime rather than before execution, as well as identifying commonly-used portions of code to avoid costly compilation and recompilation.</p>
      <p><span class="bolded">Dynamically typed</span>: Type safety of JavaScript programs is verified at runtime rather than compile time like Java and
      C/C++.</p>
      <p><span class="bolded">Object-oriented</span>: JavaScript uses prototypes for object-orientation rather than classes.</p>
      <p><span class="bolded">Functional</span>: Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables,
      returned from functions, and passed as arguments to other functions.</p>
