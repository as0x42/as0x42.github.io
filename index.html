    <p>Hi, my name is Aaron. I'm a writer and software developer. Professionally, I'm driven by a belief in science and engineering as a means of improving the human condition. I'm deeply curious about the hidden infrastructure that runs our world and how it can be made more effective in serving businesses, governments, communities, and individuals.</p>
    
    <p>In my spare time, I do worldbuilding, listen to music, and research esoteric topics that inevitably <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerdsnipe</a> me.</p>
